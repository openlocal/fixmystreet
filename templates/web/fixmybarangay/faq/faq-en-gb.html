<h1><a name="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>What is FixMyBarangay?</dt>
        <dd>FixMyBarangay is a site to help people report, view,
or discuss local problems they&rsquo;ve found to the city departments.
The pilot project lets you report the problems by SMS (or dropping
into the barangay center).
</dd>
      <dt>What areas are covered?</dt>
      <dd>
          The pilot project is just running in two barangays in Cebu &ndash;
          Luz and Basak San Nicolas.
      </dd>
        <dt>What sort of problems should I report with FixMyBarangay?</dt>
        <dd>The FixMyBarangay pilot project is just for potholes (and similar 
          road surface problems) and broken streetlights.
        </dd>

    <dt>What isn&rsquo;t FixMyBarangay for?</dt>
    <dd>FixMyStreet is not a way of getting in touch with Cebu City Hall for other problems
    &ndash; please use FixMyBarangay only for potholes and streetlights while the pilot 
    project is running.. 
    </dd>

        <dt>Staff only: How do I use the site?</dt>
        <dd>If you have a staff login, you can view problems already reported in that area,
or report ones of your own simply by clicking on the map at the location of
the problem.</dd>
        <dt>How are the problems solved?</dt>
        <dd>Problems sent by SMS are initially handled by the barangay staff &ndash; they'll
          confirm the problem and report it to the relevant department automatically. 
          Once it's in the department's problem-tracking system, they'll get onto it as 
          soon as they can.</dd>
        <dt>Is it free?</dt>
        <dd>The site is free to use, yes. The pilot project has been funded by the World Bank.</dd>

    <h2><a name="practical"></a>Staff questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>What's my login?</dt>
        <dd>
            You can use your email address and set a password right away, but your 
            account won't be enabled as a <em>staff account</em> until one of the
            system administrators has checked it. If you're not sure who to contact, try
            <a href="mailto:[% c.config.CONTACT_EMAIL %]">[% c.config.CONTACT_EMAIL %]</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>I've forgotten my password, what do I do?</dt>
        <dd>
           No problem â€” when you log in, if you can't remember your password we'll
           send you a confirmation link which lasts for one session, and you can 
           reset your password once you've clicked on that.
        </dd>
        <dt>How do I sign out?</dt>
        <dd>
            Either click on <a href="/auth/sign_out">sign out</a> on the page you're on,
            or quit the browser (just closing the window without quitting the browser is not enough).
        </dd>
        <dt>Reporting</dt>
        <dd><p>
            To make a new report, start by clicking on the button for either barangay <em>BSN</em> or <em>Luz</em>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>To create a standalone report</strong> simply click on the map where the problem is. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>To create a report from a text message</strong> log into Message Manager (see below),
                    then select the message you want to use (click on the radio button). When the message has gone
                    green, you can click on the map and the message will automatically be used to create the report.
                    You can edit the text, but that report will be associated with that incoming message.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Once you've placed the pin, but before you press <em>Submit</em>, you can drag or reposition the pin
                if you want to change its position.
            </p>
            <p>
                Choose the category for this report &dash; obviously, this helps FixMyBarangay decide to which 
                department the report will be sent.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>How do I see the SMS messages people have sent?</dt>
        <dd>When you look at the barangay problems, click on <em>Problems via text</em>
            (or, if you're viewing a specific report, click <em>Show messages</em>) to see the
            currently available messages. You'll need a username and password
            for the Message Manager (your manager will have told you what these
            are). Note that you can only see messages that have not yet been used to 
            create a report (and also their replies).
        </dd>
        <dt>Is my Message Manager username and password the same as the ones I use for FixMyBarangay?</dt>
        <dd>
            No, it's a separate account (some FMB users don't have any access to the SMS messages).
            Your manager will tell you what your login for Message Manager system is, if you have one.
        </dd>
        <dt>I tried to work with a message but it said "Someone is working with that message right now!" What's up?</dt>
        <dd>
            This means another staff member has a "lock" on the message. To prevent you both creating
            a report, or sending a reply, we use a first-come-first-serve locking mechanism.
            Collisions like this are rare, but if they do happen, try again a few minutes later
            because the lock may have expired by then.
        </dd>
        <dt>Can I delete a message?</dt>
        <dd>
            Yes. Click on the red cross when you hover over it (although really you're only hiding it so
            it never gets shown within FixMyBarangay). 
            You need a manager's account in the Message Manager to be able to see any 
            messages that have been hidden, so hiding them is as good as deleting them.
        </dd>
        <dt>It looks like an incoming message is wrongly shown as a reply. Can I fix it?</dt>
        <dd>
            FixMyBarangay tries to recognise SMS replies, and automatically matches them to the right thread. If it 
            gets this wrong you can click on the <em>detach</em> button. The message will then be a new "available"
            message. If Message Manager got it wrong the other way round, and missed a reply, you can fix this too
            but you need to log into Message Manager with a manager's account to do it.
        </dd>
        <dt>How do the replies get back to the original sender?</dt>
        <dd>
            Although you're replying from within FixMyBarangay, the replies are sent by SMS.
            There may be a delay of a several minutes between the moment you press <strong>reply</strong>
            and the message's arrival.
        </dd>
        <dt>How can I tell the original sender their problem has been fixed?</dt>
        <dd>
            Go to the report. If the report is marked "this report was submitted by SMS", you can send a reply.
            Click on <em>Show Messages</em>. When the messages appear, click on <em>Show messages for
            <strong>this</strong> report</em>. Hover over the message you want to send the message to, and 
            click <em>Reply</em>.
        </dd>
