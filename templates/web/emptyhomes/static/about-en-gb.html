    <h2>The Empty Homes Agency</h2>

    <p>The Empty Homes agency is an independent campaigning charity. We
    are not part of government, and have no formal links with local councils
    although we work in cooperation with both. We exist to highlight the waste
    of empty property and work with others to devise and promote sustainable
    solutions to bring empty property back into use. We are based in London but
    work across England. We also work in partnership with other charities across
    the UK.</p>

    <h2>Shelter<br>Cymru</h2>

    <p>Shelter Cymru is Wales&rsquo; people and homes charity and wants
    everyone in Wales to have a decent home. We believe a home is a fundamental
    right and essential to the health and well-being of people and communities.
    We work for people in housing need. We have offices all over Wales and
    prevent people from losing their homes by offering free, confidential and
    independent advice. When necessary we constructively challenge on behalf of
    people to ensure they are properly assisted and to improve practice and
    learning. We believe that bringing empty homes back into use can make a
    significant contribution to the supply of affordable homes in Wales.

    <h2>The Scottish Empty Homes Partnership</h2>

<p>The Scottish Empty Homes Partnership works with Scottish Local Authorities
and their partners to help them bring the 23,000+ long term private sector
empty homes in Scotland back into use. In existence since June 2010, the
Partnership is funded by Scottish Government and hosted by Shelter Scotland.

<p>We provide training for empty homes officers, share best practice, link
industry professionals and provide consultancy and advice to councils and
others working to bring private sector empty homes back into use. We aim to
highlight the opportunities for communities in bringing empty homes back into
use. Based on our experience we also make recommendations for changes in both
practice and policy on local and national levels. To find out more about the
work we do please
