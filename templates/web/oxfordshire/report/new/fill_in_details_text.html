Oxfordshire County Council wonâ€™t be able to help unless you leave as much
detail as you can. Please describe the exact location of the problem (e.g. in
the carriageway), what it is, how long it has been there, a description and a
photo of the problem if you have one. Please be aware that you can only attach
one picture so ensure that you provide a picture that clearly shows the
location not just the fault.
