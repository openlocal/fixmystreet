<h1>Privacy, cookies, and third party services</h1>

<p><strong>Our use of your data, cookies, and external services: what you should know, and how to opt out if you want to.</strong></p>

<p>Summary: We care a lot about our users’ privacy. We provide details below,
and we try our hardest to look after the private data that we hold. Like many
other websites, we sometimes use cookies and Google Analytics to help us make
our websites better. These tools are very common and used by many other sites,
but they do have privacy implications, and as a charity concerned with socially
positive uses of the internet, we think it’s important to explain them in full.
If you don’t want to share your browsing activities on mySociety’s sites with
other companies, you can adjust your usage or install opt-out browser plugins.

    <dl>
        <dt>Who gets to see my email address?</dt>
        <dd>If you submit a problem, we pass on your details, and details
of the problem, to the council contact or contacts responsible for the
area where you located the problem, or other relevant body (for example, in
most of London we send reports via the central London Report-It service, who
may also publish the public details of your report). Other than the council, who obviously get your
email address, only people we authorise to view the FixMyStreet administration interface
will be able to see your email address and they will never use it for anything other than 
to help administer FixMyStreet. Similarly with email addresses from updates. We will never give or sell your email address to anyone else, 
unless we are obliged to by law. Your name, given in the name field, will not
be published anywhere unless you let us (if you give your name elsewhere, e.g.
in the public details section, it will be publicly available).</dd>
        <dt>Will you send nasty, brutish spam to my email address?</dt>
        <dd>Never. We will email you if someone leaves an update on a
problem you&rsquo;ve reported, and send you a questionnaire email four weeks
after you submit a problem, asking for a status update; we&rsquo;ll only ever
send you emails in relation to your problem.</dd>
    </dl>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>To make our service easier or more useful, we sometimes place small data files on your computer or mobile phone, known as cookies; many websites do this. We use this information to, for example, remember you have logged in so you don't need to do that on every page, or to measure how people use the website so we can improve it and make sure it works properly. Below, we list the cookies and services that this site can use.
